A fresh, _modern_ & lightweight HTML5 game engine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![melonJS](https://melonjs.org/img/alex4-github.png)

melonJS 2 is a modern version of the melonJS game engine. It has been rebuilt almost entirely using ES6 class, inheritance and semantic, and is bundled using Rollup to provide modern features such as transpiling and tree-shaking.

>Note: migrating an existing project to melonJS 2 (version 10.0 and higher) will definitely break your game (ES6 semantic, no more Jay inheritance, nodeJS event emitter, and no backward compatibility with deprecated legacy APIs), and you might want to read first this small step by step guide on [upgrading to melonJS 2](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/wiki/Upgrading-to-melonJS-2). If you are looking at the legacy version (9.x and lower) of melonJS, you can find it [here](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/tree/legacy) under the _legacy_ branch.

[melonJS](https://melonjs.org/) is open-source, licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md), and actively developed and maintained with the help of a small team of enthusiasts at AltByte in Singapore.

# Using melonJS

### For your first time using melonJS, this is where you start

- [melonJS: Hacking a Platformer Game](https://melonjs.org/tutorial/)

You may find it useful to skim the overview found at the wiki [Details & Usage](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/wiki#details--usage)

When starting your own projects, checkout our [es6 boilerplate](https://github.com/melonjs/es6-boilerplate)

Demos
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few demos of melonJS capabilities :

* [Platformer Demo](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/platformer/)
* [Isometric Demo](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/isometric_rpg/)
* [Sprite Demo](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/sprite/)
* [Masking Demo](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/masking/)
* [Primitive Drawing Demo](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/graphics/)
* [UI Demo](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/UI/)

More examples are available [here](https://melonjs.github.io/examples/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic [Hello World](https://jsfiddle.net/obiot/4o9f02tc/) Example

```JavaScript
import * as me from "https://esm.run/melonjs";

me.device.onReady(function () {
    // initialize the display canvas once the device/browser is ready
    if (!me.video.init(1218, 562, {parent : "screen", scale : "auto"})) {
        alert("Your browser does not support HTML5 canvas.");
        return;
    }

    // add a gray background to the default Stage
    me.game.world.addChild(new me.ColorLayer("background", "#202020"));

    // add a font text display object
    me.game.world.addChild(new me.Text(609, 281, {
        font: "Arial",
        size: 160,
        fillStyle: "#FFFFFF",
        textBaseline : "middle",
        textAlign : "center",
        text : "Hello World !"
    }));
});
```
> Simple hello world using melonJS 2 (version 10.x or higher)

Download melonJS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The latest builds with corresponding release note are available for direct download [here](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/releases).

Since version 10.0.0 melonJS provides different build options :

| build               | description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `melonjs.module.js` | the ES6 Module (ESM) Bundle |
| `melonjs.module.d.ts` | typescript declaration file for the ES6 Module (ESM) Bundle |
| `melonjs.js`        | a ES5 UMD Bundle (directly transpiled from the ES6 version) |
| `melonjs.min.js`    | a minified version of the ES5 UMD bundle |

Alternatively, the latest version of melonJS can be installed through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/melonjs) :

    $ npm install melonjs

If you need to import the ES6 module of melonjs (e.g. for Webpack):

    $ import * as me from 'melonjs/dist/melonjs.module.js';

Or can simply be added to your html, using [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/melonjs) content delivery network (CDN) :

```html
<!-- load the ES6 module bundle of melonJS v10.0 -->
<script src="https://esm.run/melonjs@10.0"></script>
<!-- omit the version completely to get the latest one -->
<!-- you should NOT use this in production -->
<script src="https://esm.run/melonjs"></script>
```
> Note: starting from the 10.0.0 version, the debug plugin is no longer provided as part of the melonJS library release, and has been moved to the official [boilerplate](https://github.com/melonjs/es6-boilerplate)

Building melonJS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For most users, all you probably want is to use melonJS, and all you need then is just to download the latest built [release](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS#download-melonjs) to get started. The only time you should need to build melonJS is if you want to contribute to the project and start developing on it.

To build your own version of melonJS you will need to install :

- The [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime and the [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) package manager

Once Node.js and NPM have been installed, you need to install build dependencies,
by executing the following in the folder where you cloned the repository :

    $ [sudo] npm install

Then build the melonJS source by running:

    $ npm run build

The generated library will be available under the `build` directory :
- `melonjs.js` : plain ES5 UMD bundle
- `melonjs.min.js` : minified ES5 UMD bundle
- `melonjs.module.js` : plain ES6 module
- `melonjs.module.d.ts` : typescript declaration for the ES6 Module

To run the melonJS test suite simply use the following:

    $ npm run test

This will run the jasmine spec tests with the output displayed on the shell. Do
note that the latest Chrome version is required, as the test unit will run the
Browser in a headless mode (in case of failed tests, upgrade your browser).

Last but not least, if you really want to contribute, but not sure how, you can
always check our [discussions](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/discussions/categories/ideas) list to get some idea on where to start.

Building the documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, you can build your own copy of the docs locally by running :

    $ npm run doc

The generated documentation will be available in the `docs` directory

WIP Builds
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
latest WIP builds are available under [`dist`](dist/) in the [master](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/tree/master) branch.
